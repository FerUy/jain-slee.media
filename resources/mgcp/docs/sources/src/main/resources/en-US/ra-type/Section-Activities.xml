	<para>
		An MGCP activity object represents a set of related events in an
		MGCP resource. This Ra Type defines the following Activity
		objects:

				<para>
					The set of MGCP events regarding the managing (creation,
					modification, destruction and state audit) of a MGCP
					connection is represented by this activity object. This
					activity ends implicitly when a DeleteConnection (MGCP
					server role) or DeleteConnectionResponse (MGCP Call
					Agent role) event is received. MGCP events related to
					Signal generation or Event detection request for
					specific connection are also represented by this
					Activity. Class name is

					events and receive further related messages from a MGCP

				<para>
					The set of MGCP events regarding a MGCP endpoint, such
					as event detecting/signal generation or
					configuration/state audit, is represented by this
					activity object. Since a MGCP endpoint doesn't have a
					lifecyle this activity does not end implicitly on MGCP
					events. Class name is

				<para>
