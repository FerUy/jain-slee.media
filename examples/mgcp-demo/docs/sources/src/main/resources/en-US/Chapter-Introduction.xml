The MGCP assumes		that these call control elements, or Call Agents, will		synchronize with each other to send coherent commands and		responses to the gateways (mdia servers) under their control. If		this assumption is violated, inconsistent behavior should be		expected. MGCP does not define a mechanism for synchronizing		Call Agents. MGCP is, in essence, a master/slave protocol, where		the gateways are expected to execute commands sent by the Call		Agents.	</para>	<para>		This example demonstrates how MGCP RA can be used as Media		Gateway Call Controller to control the Media Gateway (Media		Server)	</para>	<para>		Prior knowledge of MGCP is necessary to understand this example.		To learn about MGCP, look at <ulink url="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3435.html">RFC 3435</ulink>. Knowledge of MGCP RA is		also desired.	</para></chapter>
